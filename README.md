# Advent of Code

## 2020

Solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) (the worst
year in human history).

Also, the year I've decided to learn Rust. This is my first ever Rust code and
already I hate it. Implicit returns? No scanf? Have to import traits to use
them? "Easy" but super complicated memory management? Ugh... I'm sure I'll come
around to it.


## 2019
These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

Trying to learn Python in greater depth this year. Got frustrated with
performance in some of the brute-force solutions so switched back to Go.
